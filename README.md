# DynamicSearcha

`DynamicSearcha` is a Dart package that provides implementations of various search algorithms, including Linear Search, Binary Search, and Jump Search. It includes performance measurements for each search operation.

## Features

- **Linear Search**: Finds the target element by checking each element sequentially.
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches for the target element in a sorted list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- **Jump Search**: Searches for the target element by jumping ahead by fixed steps and performing a linear search in the identified block.
